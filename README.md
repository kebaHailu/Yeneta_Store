  # Yeneta Store 📝  
  This is a simple project developed by Django framework with basic CRUD operation including Create a Product, Read(see) a Product, Update(modify) the exisiting product and Delete the product. for the backend I used django itself and for front-end I used template and jinja as well.
  ## Get Started 🚀  
~~~python  
# 1.Navigate to the directory where your requirements.txt file 
#   is located. then use the following command
pip install -r requirements.txt

# after that make sure the manage.py file exist in the current directory and run the following code
python manage.py runserver 
# this will initate the server and give you the link

  ## Prebuilt Components/Templates 🔥
