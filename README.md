  # Yeneta Store 📝  
  This is a simple project developed by the Django framework with basic CRUD operations including Creating a Product, Reading (seeing) a Product, Update(modifying) the existing product, and Delete the product. for the backend, I used Django itself and for front end I used Template and Jinja as well.
  ## Get Started 🚀  
~~~python  
# 1. Navigate to the directory where your requirements.txt file 
#   is located. then use the following command
pip install -r requirements.txt

# After that make sure the manage.py file exist in the current directory and run the following code
python manage.py runserver 
# This will initiate the server and give you the link 
~~~  

  ## Prebuilt Components/Templates 🔥 
  I used Bootstrap for design and Crispy for the form which is mostly used for Django
